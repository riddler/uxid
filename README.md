# UXID [![Issues][issues_shield]][issues_url] [![MIT License][license_shield]][license_url]

This project contains the specification and reference implementations of a type of unique identifier called a UXID.

UXID stands for **U**ser e**X**perience focused **ID**entifier and is similar to a [ULID][ulid_url], with a strong focus on UX.

## Why UXIDs?

ID generation is a fun topic (for some :) and there are many existing libraries to do so (see [Alternatives]).
UXIDs build on strong concepts from some of these alternatives and have these primary goals:

  * User experience focused
  * No coordination, no collisions, no (fixed) cardinality
  * Sortable by time

### User Experience Focused

Most ID generation libraries focus on creating unique identifiers to work for the system (often distributed) and give little thought to the humans who use them.

Who are these humans you speak of? There are two large groups:

* The customer and tech support heros who need to easily pronounce and hear them over the phone.
* The engineers investigating a complex issue with multiple objects of different types.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  UXIDs are identifiers which:
  
  * describe the resource (to help in debugging and investigation)
  * work well with copy and paste (double clicking should select the entire ID)
  * can be shortened for low cardinality resources
  * are very unlikely to collide
  * are secure against enumeration attacks
  * can be generated by application code (not tied to the datastore)
  * are K-sortable (lexicographically sortable by time - works well with datastore indexing)
  * do not require any coordination (human or automated) at startup, or generation


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

  To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

  ### Installation

  1. Clone and cd into the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/riddler/uxid.git
  cd uxid
  ```
  2. Install dependencies and setup the development environment
  ```sh
  ./bin/setup
  ```
