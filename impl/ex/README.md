# UXID

UXIDs are identifiers which:

* Describe the resource (aid in debugging and investigation)
* Use Crockford encoding (work well with humans)
  * Compact - hard to manipulate or read long strings of characters
  * Prononounceable - easily and accurately transmit characters to another human using a telephone
* Work well with copy and paste (double clicking selects the entire ID)
* Can be shortened for low cardinality resources
* Are very unlikely to collide (more likely with less randomness)
* Are secure against enumeration attacks
* Can be generated by application code (not tied to the datastore)
* Are K-sortable (lexicographically sortable by time - works well with datastore indexing)
* Do not require any coordination (human or automated) at startup, or generation

Many of the concepts of Stripe IDs have been used in this library.

## Usage

```elixir
# No options generates a basic ULID
UXID.generate! # "01EMDGJF0DQXQJ8FM78XE97Y3H"

# A prefix can be provided
UXID.generate! prefix: "cus" # "cus_01EMDGJF0DQXQJ8FM78XE97Y3H"

# The amount of randomness can be decreased for smaller cardinality resources
UXID.generate! prefix: "cus", rand_size: 4 # "cus_01EMDGN5QAGPWSKN2"
```

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `uxid` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:uxid, "~> 0.0.4"}
  ]
end
```
