UXIDs are identifiers which:

* Describe the resource (aid in debugging and investigation)
* Prononounceable - easily and accurately transmit characters to another human using a telephone
* Work well with copy and paste (double clicking selects the entire ID)
* Can be shortened for low cardinality resources
* Are very unlikely to collide (more likely with less randomness)
* Are secure against enumeration attacks
* Can be generated by application code (not tied to the datastore)
* Are K-sortable (lexicographically sortable by time - works well with datastore indexing)
* Do not require any coordination (human or automated) at startup, or generation

Many of the concepts of Stripe IDs have been used in this library.

## Usage

#### Generating UXIDs

```elixir
# No options generates a basic ULID
UXID.generate! # "01EMDGJF0DQXQJ8FM78XE97Y3H"

# A prefix can be provided
UXID.generate! prefix: "cus" # "cus_01EMDGJF0DQXQJ8FM78XE97Y3H"

# The amount of randomness can be decreased for smaller cardinality resources
UXID.generate! prefix: "cus", rand_size: 4 # "cus_01EMDGN5QAGPWSKN2"
```

#### Ecto

UXIDs can be used as Ecto fields including primary keys.

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.User do
  use Ecto.Schema

  @primary_key {:id, Ecto.UXID, autogenerate: true, prefix: "usr", rand_size: 5}
  schema "users" do
    field :generated_uxid, Ecto.UXID, autogenerate: true, prefix: "apikey"
    field :api_secret, Ecto.UXID, prefix: "apisecret"
  end
end
```

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `uxid` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:uxid, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```
